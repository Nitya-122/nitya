    <p>Let us explore all the planets and learn more about our solar system</p>
    <h2>MERCURY</h2>
    <p>Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system. It’s just a little bigger than Earth’s moon. It is the closest planet to the sun, but it’s actually not the hottest. Venus is hotter.
       Along with Venus, Earth, and Mars, Mercury is one of the rocky planets. It has a solid surface that is covered with craters. It has no atmosphere, and it doesn’t have any moons. Mercury likes to keep things simple.
       This small planet spins around slowly compared to Earth, so one day lasts a long time. Mercury takes 59 Earth days to make one full rotation. A year on Mercury goes by fast. Because it’s the closest planet to the sun, it doesn’t take very long to go all the way around. It completes one revolution around the sun in just 88 Earth days. 
       If you lived on Mercury, you’d have a birthday every three months!
    </p>
    
    <h2>Venus</h2>
    <p>Venus looks like a very active planet. It has mountains and volcanoes. Venus is similar in size to Earth. Earth is just a little bit bigger.
       Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system.It is a terrestrial planet. It is small and rocky and has a thick atmosphere. It traps heat and makes Venus very hot.
       Venus has an active surface, including volcanoes!Venus spins the opposite direction of Earth and most other planets.
       Venus has a rotation which has been slowed and turned against its orbital direction (retrograde) by the strong currents and drag of its atmosphere. This rotation produces, together with the time of 224.7 Earth days it takes Venus to complete an orbit around the Sun (a Venusian solar year), a Venusian solar day length of 117 Earth days,
        the longest in the Solar System, resulting in a Venusian year being just under two Venusian days long. The orbits of Venus and Earth are the closest between any two Solar System planets, approaching each other in synodic periods of 1.6 years.
    </p>
    <h2>Earth</h2>
    <p>Our home planet Earth is a rocky, terrestrial planet. It has a solid and active surface with mountains, valleys, canyons, plains and so much more. Earth is special because it is an ocean planet. Water covers 70% of Earth's surface.
        Our atmosphere is made mostly of nitrogen and has plenty of oxygen for us to breathe. The atmosphere also protects us from incoming meteoroids, most of which break up in our atmosphere before they can strike the surface as meteorites.
        Earth is rounded into an ellipsoid with a circumference of about 40,000 km. It is the densest planet in the Solar System. Of the four rocky planets, it is the largest and most massive. Earth is about eight light-minutes away from the Sun and orbits it, taking a year (about 365.25 days) to complete one revolution.
        Earth rotates around its own axis in slightly less than a day (in about 23 hours and 56 minutes). Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to the perpendicular to its orbital plane around the Sun, producing seasons.
    <ul type="square">
        <li>Earth has just one Moon. It is the only planet to have just one moon.</li>
        <li>Earth has lots of spacecraft watching it. There is still a lot we can learn about our home planet.</li>
        <li>Earth is the third planet from the Sun in our solar system. That means Venus and Mars are Earth’s neighboring planets.</li>
    </ul>

    </p>
    <h2>Mars</h2>
    <p>Mars is a cold desert world. It is half the size of Earth. Mars is sometimes called the Red Planet. It's red because of rusty iron in the ground.
        Like Earth, Mars has seasons, polar ice caps, volcanoes, canyons, and weather. It has a very thin atmosphere made of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and argon.
        There are signs of ancient floods on Mars, but now water mostly exists in icy dirt and thin clouds. On some Martian hillsides, there is evidence of liquid salty water in the ground.
        Scientists want to know if Mars may have had living things in the past. They also want to know if Mars could support life now or in the future.
        Mars is among the brightest objects in Earth's sky, and thus has been known from the ancient times. Its high-contrast albedo features make it a common subject for viewing with a telescope. Since the late 20th century, Mars has been explored by uncrewed spacecraft and rovers, with the first flyby by the Mariner 4 probe in 1965, the first Mars orbiter by the Mars 2 probe in 1971, and the first landing by Viking 1 in 1976.
    
    </p>
    <h2>Jupiter</h2>
    <p>Jupiter is the biggest planet in our solar system. It's similar to a star, but it never got massive enough to start burning. It is covered in swirling cloud stripes. It has big storms like the Great Red Spot, which has been going for hundreds of years. Jupiter is a gas giant and doesn't have a solid surface, but it may have a solid inner core about the size of Earth. 
       Jupiter also has rings, but they're too faint to see very well.
       Jupiter has 80 confirmed moons.It is the fifth planet from the Sun. That means Mars and Saturn are Jupiter’s neighboring planets.
       Jupiter is surrounded by a faint planetary ring system and has a powerful magnetosphere, the largest contiguous structure in the Solar System after the heliosphere. Jupiter forms a system of 95 known moons and probably many more, including the four large moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Ganymede, the largest of the four, is larger than the planet Mercury. 
       Callisto is the second largest; Io and Europa are approximately the size of Earth's Moon.
    </p>
    <h2>Saturn</h2>
    <p>Saturn isn’t the only planet to have rings, but it definitely has the most beautiful ones. The rings we see are made of groups of tiny ringlets that surround Saturn. They’re made of chunks of ice and rock. Like Jupiter, Saturn is mostly a ball of hydrogen and helium.
        When Galileo Galilei saw Saturn through a telescope in the 1600s, he wasn't sure what he was seeing. At first he thought he was looking at three planets, or a planet with handles. Now we know those "handles" turned out to be the rings of Saturn.
        Saturn is the only planet of the Solar System that is less dense than water—about 30% less.[38] Although Saturn's core is considerably denser than water, the average specific density of the planet is 0.69 g/cm3 due to the atmosphere.
    </p>
    <h2>Uranus</h2>
    <p>Uranus is made of water, methane, and ammonia fluids above a small rocky center. Its atmosphere is made of hydrogen and helium like Jupiter and Saturn, but it also has methane. The methane makes Uranus blue.
        Uranus also has faint rings. The inner rings are narrow and dark. The outer rings are brightly colored and easier to see. Like Venus, Uranus rotates in the opposite direction as most other planets. And unlike any other planet, Uranus rotates on its side.
        Uranus is visible to the naked eye, but it is very dim and was not classified as a planet until 1781, when it was first observed by William Herschel. About seven decades after its discovery, consensus was reached that the planet be named from the Greek god Uranus (Ouranos), one of the Greek primordial deities.
    </p>
    <h2>Neptune</h2>
    <p>Neptune is dark, cold, and very windy. It's the last of the planets in our solar system. It's more than 30 times as far from the sun as Earth is. Neptune is very similar to Uranus. It's made of a thick fog of water, ammonia, and methane over an Earth-sized solid center. 
        Its atmosphere is made of hydrogen, helium, and methane. The methane gives Neptune the same blue color as Uranus. Neptune has six rings, but they're very hard to see.
        <ul type="square">
            <li>Neptune is encircled by six rings.</li>
            <li>Neptune, like Uranus, is an ice giant. It’s similar to a gas giant. It is made of a thick soup of water, ammonia, and methane flowing over a solid core about the size of Earth.</li>
            <li>Neptune has a thick, windy atmosphere.</li>
